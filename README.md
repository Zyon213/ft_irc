# ft_irc

This project is about creating your own IRC server.
You will use an actual IRC client to connect to your server and test it.
Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact
with each other.
Itâ€™s always a good thing to know.

Internet Relay Chat or IRC is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet.
It offers real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchange
direct messages and join group channels.
IRC clients connect to IRC servers in order to join channels. IRC servers are connected
together to form a network.
